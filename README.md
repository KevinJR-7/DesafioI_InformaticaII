# Desafio I - Informatica II (2025-1)

This repository contains the development of **Challenge 1** for the course *Informatica II* (Semester 2025-1).

## 🧠 Problem Overview

The challenge involves reverse-engineering an image that was distorted through a series of unknown bit-level transformations — including XOR operations, bit rotations, and bit shifts — combined with partial masking using a color mask.

The goal is to identify and reverse the sequence of transformations applied to the original image, using only the final distorted image and auxiliary files.
